<h2 id="i-am">I am</h2>

<p>an agile coach, change manager and distributed agile teams evangelist.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>

<p>I speak, I write, I organize.</p>

<p>I am helping teams and organizations becoming truly agile, high performing teams and organizations.</p>

<p>I facilitate non-agile teams who are ready for change or teams who like to boost their current agile approach.</p>

<p>I am providing seminars and trainings on agile leadership, agile methods such as scrum and kanban and remote team work.</p>

<p>I run inhouse workshops with and for teams and I coach team leaders.
I take on the role as Scrum Master or Kanban Master in order to make sure your team succeeds with its agile transition.</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-me-different">What makes me different</h2>

<p>I have been in IT for more than 20 years by now. I held managerial positions in project management, in marketing and consultancy. I have run local teams and I have run globally distributed teams spanning different cultures, timezones and languages.</p>

<p>I am a trained expert in organizational behavior, organizational development and organizational design.</p>

<p>Therefore I will always start with your strategic goals. I will talk with you about key performance indicators such as revenue and profit, number of bugs, customer satisfaction and more. And I will show your team leaders and managers how agile management is not about establishing a culture of “fun” and setting up fancy offices. Agile at its core is all about setting up a highly structured production system designed for high performance in highly competitive markets.</p>

<h2 id="what-my-clients-say-about-me">What my clients say about me</h2>

<p>Yes, I have clients who provide nice testimonials and you can look them up. However, why don’t you just show up at one of my events and meeting me in person?</p>

<h2 id="my-style">My style</h2>

<p>As a coach my work is based on mutual trust and respect. If you don’t need a written contract then I don’t need one either.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-in-touch">How to get in touch</h2>

<p>If you like to get in touch and have a chat, drop me an email: mailto:lucius.bobikiewicz@lubob.net.</p>
