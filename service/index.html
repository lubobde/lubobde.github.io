<h2 id="distributed-agile-teams-kickstarter-workshop">Distributed Agile Teams – Kickstarter Workshop</h2>

<p>Are you about to set up a distributed development team? Do you need to get your team into work mode as quick as possible?</p>

<p>Then this <a href="link">Kickstarter workshop</a> is right for you!</p>

<p>Setting up a distributed development team is a fuzzy and time consuming task, much more complex and demanding and requires much more than just setting up a file server and a Skype account.</p>

<p>However, every organisation is different and every team requires a different, customized approach which matches its specific goals while taking into account it’s mother organisation’s specific strengths and constraints.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-in-for-you">What is in for you:</h3>

<p>At the end of this workshop you will receive a comprehensive plan with tools, measures and activities for setting up your distributed team environment.
With this roadmap at hand your team will be much faster operational. Spent time on development and team building, don’t waste it on unnecessary research and experiments.
You will reduce your expenses by avoiding inappropriate tools and services and thereby protect your overall budget.</p>

<p>The Workshop consist of four parts:</p>

<h4 id="goals-and-constraints">Goals and Constraints</h4>

<p>Every team and every organisation is different. Therefore we start with a short workshop about your team’s mission, goals and constrains. We will together identify and list what will have an impact on your setup such as short-term and long-term goals, geographical distribution, team structure, technical constrains, company policies etc.</p>

<h4 id="workplaces">Workplaces</h4>

<p>The next step is to define the tool set for your developers workstations. This is all about the on-site installed hardware and software such as chat programs, webcams, screen sharing tools, live editors etc.
Shared Infrastructure
During the Infrastructure session we will be defining the central, off-site systems your production system will rely on such as the ticket system, virtual boards, repositories, build servers and more.</p>

<h4 id="agile-practices">Agile Practices</h4>

<p>In comparison to co-located teams distributed agile teams require a much strong and tighter set of procedures and practices in order to function well.
Therefore we will also work out the first set of rules and routines for your team for day to day communication and for the agile practices. We will work out how to run the daily, planning sessions, retros and more.</p>

<h2 id="distributed-teams-coaching">Distributed Teams Coaching</h2>

<p>Since the beginning of the agile movement thousands of companies all over the world have learned that the most effective approach for going agile is to take an experienced coach on board for a limited period of time.</p>

<p>Improve your teams performance by taking in an experienced trainer and coach.</p>

<p>Once you hire me I will</p>

<ul>
<li>setup a monitoring and reporting system for providing accurate up-to-date information about the your team’s productivity and your project’s status</li>
<li>coach your Scrum Master and your team on the nuts &amp; bolts of communication best practices in an distributed environment</li>
<li>review and if necessary improve all your team’s agile practices such as Daily Standup, planning meetings, retrospectives etc…</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="spreadscrum-training-for-distributed-agile">SpreadScrum training for distributed Agile</h2>

<p>SpreadScrum is a set of facilitation and group work techniques for distributed agile teams.</p>

<p>SpreadScrum combines an easy to learn facilitation approach with a simplicity oriented tool set.</p>

<p>In SpreadScrum no special tools are required. Simple – but well designed – Spreadsheets substitute completely the cards and boards used co-located teams.
The SpreadScrum method covers all formats and practices required for distributed agile such as Daily Standups, Story Poker, Back Log Grooming, Planning Meetings, Retrospectives and more.</p>

<p>SpreadScrum is easy to learn and will drastically reduce the technical and organisational overhead most distributed teams carry around.</p>

<h2 id="temporary-scrum-master-kanban-master-agile-coach">Temporary Scrum Master / Kanban Master / Agile Coach</h2>

<p>You haven’t found a Scrum Master for your team or your Scrum Master moved on and you need someone to step in here and now?</p>

<p>I am taking on temporary gigs as Scrum Master / Kanban Master or Agile Coach for both, co-located and distributed teams.</p>

<p>For co-located teams I can take on assignments in Central Europe while for distributed teams there is obivously no geographical constrain.</p>

<p>Sent me an email at mailto:lucius.bobikiewicz@lubob.net and I will discuss with you what’s possible or not. In case I am not available, I will still be happy to introduce you to qualified colleagues of mine.</p>
