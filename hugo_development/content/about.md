## I am

an agile coach, change manager and distributed agile teams evangelist.

## What I do

I speak, I write, I organize.

I am helping teams and organizations becoming truly agile, high performing teams and organizations.

I facilitate non-agile teams who are ready for change or teams who like to boost their current agile approach.

I am providing seminars and trainings on agile leadership, agile methods such as scrum and kanban and remote team work.

I run inhouse workshops with and for teams and I coach team leaders.
I take on the role as Scrum Master or Kanban Master in order to make sure your team succeeds with its agile transition.

## What makes me different
I have been in IT for more than 20 years by now. I held managerial positions in project management, in marketing and consultancy. I have run local teams and I have run globally distributed teams spanning different cultures, timezones and languages.

I am a trained expert in organizational behavior, organizational development and organizational design.

Therefore I will always start with your strategic goals. I will talk with you about key performance indicators such as revenue and profit, number of bugs, customer satisfaction and more. And I will show your team leaders and managers how agile management is not about establishing a culture of “fun” and setting up fancy offices. Agile at its core is all about setting up a highly structured production system designed for high performance in highly competitive markets.

## What my clients say about me

Yes, I have clients who provide nice testimonials and you can look them up. However, why don’t you just show up at one of my events and meeting me in person?

## My style

As a coach my work is based on mutual trust and respect. If you don’t need a written contract then I don’t need one either.
