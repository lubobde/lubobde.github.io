## Distributed Agile Teams – Kickstarter Workshop
Are you about to set up a distributed development team? Do you need to get your team into work mode as quick as possible?

Then this [Kickstarter workshop](link) is right for you!

Setting up a distributed development team is a fuzzy and time consuming task, much more complex and demanding and requires much more than just setting up a file server and a Skype account.

However, every organisation is different and every team requires a different, customized approach which matches its specific goals while taking into account it’s mother organisation’s specific strengths and constraints.

### What is in for you:

At the end of this workshop you will receive a comprehensive plan with tools, measures and activities for setting up your distributed team environment.
With this roadmap at hand your team will be much faster operational. Spent time on development and team building, don’t waste it on unnecessary research and experiments.
You will reduce your expenses by avoiding inappropriate tools and services and thereby protect your overall budget.

The Workshop consist of four parts:

#### Goals and Constraints
Every team and every organisation is different. Therefore we start with a short workshop about your team’s mission, goals and constrains. We will together identify and list what will have an impact on your setup such as short-term and long-term goals, geographical distribution, team structure, technical constrains, company policies etc.

#### Workplaces
The next step is to define the tool set for your developers workstations. This is all about the on-site installed hardware and software such as chat programs, webcams, screen sharing tools, live editors etc.
Shared Infrastructure
During the Infrastructure session we will be defining the central, off-site systems your production system will rely on such as the ticket system, virtual boards, repositories, build servers and more.
#### Agile Practices
In comparison to co-located teams distributed agile teams require a much strong and tighter set of procedures and practices in order to function well.
Therefore we will also work out the first set of rules and routines for your team for day to day communication and for the agile practices. We will work out how to run the daily, planning sessions, retros and more.

## Distributed Teams Coaching
Since the beginning of the agile movement thousands of companies all over the world have learned that the most effective approach for going agile is to take an experienced coach on board for a limited period of time.
